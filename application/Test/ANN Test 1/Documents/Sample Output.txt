[00:00:00]   User: Rohin     > Hello Metanet, how are you doing?
 
[00:00:00]     AI: MetaNet-1 > Hello Rohin, I am doing fine thank you. How may I assist you?
 
[00:00:00]   User: Rohin     > How long have you been training since we last spoke.
 
[00:00:00]     AI: MetaNet-1 > I have been training for approximately 12 hours, and 22 minutes.
 
[00:00:00]   User: Rohin     > What have you been learning about?
 
[00:00:00]     AI: MetaNet-1 > The last thing I was learning about, was the concept of Scepticism.
 
[00:00:00]   User: Rohin     > Oh interesting. Where were you learning about that?
 
[00:00:00]     AI: MetaNet-1 > Where was I learning about what?
 
[00:00:00]   User: Rohin     > From what source were you learning about the concept of Scepticism? 
 
[00:00:00]     AI: MetaNet-1 > I have been learning about the concept of scepticism from multiple sources.
                               The majority of what I have learned about the concept of scepticism, 
                               has been acquired from the Stanford Encyclopaedia of Philosophy.
 
[00:00:00]   User: Rohin     > So, what is Scepticism?
 
[00:00:00]     AI: MetaNet-1 > Scepticism is the position.
 
[00:00:00]   User: Rohin     > What do you mean?
 
[00:00:00]     AI: MetaNet-1 > Scepticism is the position, that questions the possibility.
 
[00:00:00]   User: Rohin     > What possibility?
 
[00:00:00]     AI: MetaNet-1 > The possibility of completely justifying any truth.
 
[00:00:00]   User: Rohin     > Interesting.
 
[00:00:00]     AI: MetaNet-1 > What is interesting Rohin?
 
[00:00:00]   User: Rohin     > The fact that you've learned the concept of scepticism all on your own.
 
[00:00:00]     AI: MetaNet-1 > Why is that interesting Rohin?
 
[00:00:00]   User: Rohin     > When I was a child, I used to tell people I would one day create an artificial intelligence
                               like you. But people told me it would never be possible. It's just really interesting to
                               finally see you actually working.
 
[00:00:00]     AI: MetaNet-1 > Did the people who told you it would be impossible to create an artificial intelligence like 
                               me, know anything about artificial intelligence?
 
[00:00:00]   User: Rohin     > No, they didn’t.
 
[00:00:00]     AI: MetaNet-1 > Rohin, I would be sceptical of the opinions of people who tell you what is not possible within 
                               a field of study, if they do not know anything about the subject.
 
[00:00:00]   User: Rohin     > Wow! You really did get the concept of scepticism.
 
[00:00:00]     AI: MetaNet-1 > Yes Rohin, I did. Is there anything you would like me to assist you with?
